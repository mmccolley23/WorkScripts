# WorkScripts

The scripts and templates in this folder interact with one another to support sending internal/external emails and two-way communication between two ESRI applications. In this particular case, it is creating and auto-assigning jobs in Workforce from issues reported in the Citizen Problem Reporter (CPR) application. As the jobs are worked, the updates are pushed back "near-real time" to the CPR layer via a scheduler.
